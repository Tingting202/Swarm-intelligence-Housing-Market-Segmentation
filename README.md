# Swarm-intelligence-Housing-Market-Segmentation

Hi everyone! This code is for the audience who are interested in housing market segmentation using clustering methods and hedonic price modeling using regression.

This code was originally used in the paper "Swarm-Inspired Data-Driven Approach for Housing Market Segmentation: A Case Study of Taipei City" by Jieh-Haur Chen, Tingting Ji, Mu-Chun Su, Hsi-Hsien Wei, Vidya Trisandini Azzizi, and Shu-Chien Hsu. If you are using this code, please cite this paper, thanks!

The code consists of four parts, including a swarm-inspired projection (SIP) algorithm, Principal component analysis (PCA), K-means clustering, and hedonic price modeling by ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression.
